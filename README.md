# Electronic Gacha

Japan is famous for it's _gacha_ toy capusule machines. Back from a trip in Japan, I thought I'd make one strictly using materials and electronic components laying around the house.

[It became an interesting gift!](https://www.tiktok.com/@pytherinos/video/7321753713167682822)

A servo motor is used to shuffle the capsules. Laser tripwires detects if a capsule has fallen into the slot and stops the motor. An LED strip (spare from my [LED stairs project](https://github.com/abdulchaarani/LED_Stairs)) spins with the motor. Music is played during the shuffling. Those features execute in parallel and are non blocking.
